Spurrier said he felt he needed to step down now because he doesn't believe there is accountability with players if they know the coach won't be back next year.

(AP Photo/Mark Zaleski) \n",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Tyrod Taylor’s playing status is uncertain after the Bills starting quarterback hurt his left leg while rallying Buffalo to victory against Tennessee last weekend. \n",
      "The Bills took a precautionary step in addressing their quarterback depth behind backup EJ Manuel by signing free agent Josh Johnson on Tuesday. \n",
      "The move came a day after coach Rex Ryan said Taylor was “beat up” and “sore” following a 14-13 win against Tennessee. However, Ryan didn’t go into specifics when asked whether Taylor might be too sore to play Sunday, when Buffalo (3-2) hosts Cincinnati (5-0). \n",
      "“We all know he finished the game, but we’ll see how he’s doing,” Ryan said Monday. “We’ll be looking at him throughout the week. … But he’s sore now, I can tell you that much.” \n",
      "Ryan also revealed that Taylor has been bothered by a nagging ankle injury since training camp. Ryan didn’t say when or which ankle Taylor hurt. \n",
      "Ryan is expected to provide an update on Taylor’s status Wednesday, when he’s scheduled to address the media. If Taylor can’t play, Manuel would be in line to make his first start since losing the No. 1 job to Kyle Orton a month into last season. \n",
      "Replays show Taylor was initially hurt when his left leg bent awkwardly while he was dragged down by the back of his jersey by Titans linebacker Zach Brown following a 24-yard scramble midway through the fourth quarter. Brown was penalized 15 yards for a horse-collar tackle, and Taylor left the game for one play before returning for the next snap. \n",
      "Three plays later, Taylor split out as a receiver and caught a 4-yard pass from Chris Hogan before tumbling into the sideline after being struck in the right leg by Perrish Cox. Taylor got up slowly and immediately grabbed his left knee before returning to the huddle. He then hit Hogan for a go-ahead 2-yard touchdown with 5:30 left. \n",
      "Taylor was sacked four times and finished with a team-best 76 yards rushing, including a 22-yard touchdown, and completed 10 of 17 attempts for 109 yards and a touchdown. \n",
      "Bills receiver Percy Harvin was impressed by the poise Taylor showed playing through the injury upon returning to the huddle after being sidelined for one snap. \n",
      "“He just told the linemen he was going to be a limited a little bit running the ball. He said, we were going to need to protect him and let’s go win the game,” Harvin told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “To come back into the game, to still be making plays, to still be able to stay focused while being injured, a lot of times that’s very difficult to do at the quarterback position.” \n",
      "Now it’s a question as to how much time — if any — Taylor might miss. \n",
      "After playing Cincinnati, the Bills travel to London to play Jacksonville on Oct. 25 before entering their bye week off. \n",
      "Taylor is a first-time starter after winning a three-way quarterback competition. He signed with Buffalo in March after spending four seasons as Joe Flacco’s backup in Baltimore. \n",
      "Johnson was signed a day after he was cut by Indianapolis for a second time in two weeks. He provides the Bills experienced depth after Buffalo traded veteran journeyman Matt Cassel to Dallas three weeks ago. \n",
      "In six NFL seasons, Johnson has 1,042 yards passing, five touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 29 games, including five starts, split between Tampa Bay, Cleveland, Cincinnati and San Francisco. \n",
      "Johnson is familiar with offensive coordinator Greg Roman’s philosophy after working under him with the 49ers last season. \n",
      "“So far it’s been going well,” Johnson said. “I’ll learn more about what we’re doing for this week, but I feel pretty confident about picking things up.” \n",
      "The Bills turned to Johnson after first expressing interest in signing Matt Simms off the Atlanta Falcons practice squad, two people familiar with the discussions told The AP. However, Simms elected to stay in Atlanta, the two people said speaking on the condition of anonymity because the Bills did not disclose that information. \n",
      "Simms is familiar with the Bills offense after spending the preseason in Buffalo before being cut on Sept. 4. \n",
      "To make room on their roster, the Bills cut kicker Billy Cundiff a week after signing him. Cundiff replaced Jordan Gay as the team’s kickoff specialist, while veteran Dan Carpenter handled field-goal and extra-point duties. \n",

      "Article 6 Text: Inside FIFA case: How Blatter, Platini could face long bans - FOX Carolina 21 Member Center: FCC Public File Inside FIFA case: How Blatter, Platini could face long bans (AP Photo/Christophe Ena, file). FILE - In this Dec. 16, 2014 file photo FIFA president Sepp Blatter, right, and UEFA president Michel Platini talk before the semi final soccer match between Real Madrid and Cruz Azul at the Club World Cup soccer tourna... By ROB HARRISAP Sports Writer \n",
      "ZURICH (AP) - FIFA investigators are yet to be convinced there was any long-standing verbal agreement that led to Sepp Blatter secretly sanctioning the payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) to Michel Platini. \n",
      "Failing to persuade FIFA's ethics committee that the 2011 payment was legitimate led to Blatter, the FIFA president, and Platini, the head of European soccer, both being suspended for 90 days on Thursday, pending a full verdict. Both strongly deny any wrongdoing, want to see the reasons for the suspensions and have filed appeals. \n",
      "The case has removed - temporarily at least - two of the most powerful men in the game in the latest escalation of a corruption scandal that has rapidly expanded since May, when the U.S. indicted 14 officials, seven of whom were arrested in Zurich while attending the FIFA Congress. \n",
      "Although FIFA's ethics committee does not have to prove a motive for Platini's payment - unlike the Swiss attorney general - they have been exploring whether there was any connection to it being made months before Blatter gained UEFA's support in the 2011 FIFA presidential election, a person familiar with the situation told AP. \n",
      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation by FIFA's ethics committee, which could lead to lengthy bans from soccer for Blatter and Platini, is still continuing in private. \n",
      "Here is a deeper look into the issues being investigated by FIFA around the payment: \n",
      "___ \n",
      "WHY AND WHEN WAS IT MADE? \n",
      "Platini received his 2 million Swiss franc (about $2 million) windfall in February 2011, supposedly after calling in a debt from his time on the FIFA payroll as an adviser to Blatter between 1998 and 2002. \n",
      "At the time, Platini received 300,000 Swiss francs per year to travel the world with Blatter, another person familiar with the FIFA ethics case told the AP on Monday. Platini carried out the job for 3 1/2 years, collecting 1.05 million Swiss francs, before being elected to the ruling executive committees at both UEFA and FIFA in 2002. \n",
      "What Platini now claims, which is yet to be publicly endorsed by any FIFA staffers from 1998 to 2002, is that he deferred an additional 500,000 Swiss francs per year from the job agreement until the governing body could afford to pay him. \n",
      "Although FIFA did forecast a deficit of 134 million Swiss francs between 1999 and 2002, the accounts show a revenue surplus of 115 million Swiss francs by the end of the period, meaning it could have afforded to pay Platini. \n",
      "___ \n",
      "WAS THE PAYMENT LEGITIMATE? \n",
      "The Swiss attorney general is suspicious. That is why his investigators swooped on FIFA headquarters as Blatter was chairing an executive committee meeting in September and immediately quizzed the FIFA president as a suspect on allegations that he sanctioned a \"disloyal payment\" to Platini. \n",
      "Platini has a lower status in the Swiss criminal investigation, being treated as somewhere between a witness and an accused person. \n",
      "Separately, FIFA's ethics investigators received the documents that form the Swiss criminal investigation and conducted hours of interviews with Blatter and Platini. The fact they decided they should be banished from soccer - for 90 days at least while the investigation is completed - is a signal of their early assessment of the case. \n",
      "Blatter is yet to say anything himself or through his lawyers to publicly support Platini's account, while denying any illegality himself. Differing explanations are said to have been given during their interviews and contradictions in their accounts will only deepen the possibility of long bans. \n",
      "Verbal agreements for such large amounts would not be sanctioned in the corporate world in most countries. \n",
      "One aspect of the case considered within FIFA as implausible is how Platini expected to call in the debt after 2002 if Blatter was either voted out of power, quit or was no longer alive. \n",
      "Also being considered is how Platini expected to demand payment, without paperwork, if he had fallen out with Blatter after 2002 or the president had simply refused? The outstanding amount, as Platini claims, could have provided Blatter with enormous hold over the former France captain. And could it have weakened Platini's determination to take on Blatter, knowing 2 million Swiss francs was potentially at stake? \n",
      "That is why investigators have delved into the timing of the payment - February 2011 - around four months before Blatter was re-elected for a fourth term. \n",
      "A month before the vote, Platini's UEFA said it \"strongly recommends\" that European associations vote for Blatter. The incumbent was facing one challenger until Mohamed bin Hammam withdrew days before the poll after becoming embroiled in a bribery case. \n",
      "Platini insisted two weeks ago in quotes provided by UEFA: \"The fact that this payment was made a few months before the FIFA presidential elections is irrelevant since I never had any plans of becoming a candidate.\" \n",
      "A rift has grown between Platini and Blatter recently over the 79-year-old Swiss blocking the 60-year-old Frenchmen's path to the FIFA presidency. \n",
      "___ \n",
      "WHY IS THE PAYMENT ONLY EMERGING NOW? \n",
      "Few people in 2011 are likely to have known about the payment, beyond Platini and Blatter, the person familiar with the case said Tuesday. \n",
      "The Swiss attorney general will have discovered the payment either from a whistleblower, or from the more than 120 suspicious activity reports from Swiss banks or from the 11 terabytes of FIFA data seized from FIFA HQ. \n",
      "Details were then passed to FIFA's ethics investigators to ensure it could speedily conduct a case into Blatter, world football's leader of 17 years, and Platini, who has headed UEFA since 2007. \n",
      "___ \n",
      "UEFA DECISION DAY \n",
      "Hours after Platini was suspended on Thursday, UEFA declared that its executive committee \"stands fully behind\" Platini following a teleconference of members. \n",
      "But ahead of an emergency meeting of the executive committee on Thursday, cracks are showing within UEFA, sparked by Danish member Allan Hansen expressing frustration that he is yet to receive replies to many questions about the payment. His support for Platini would end if no written contract exists - which it does not. \n",
      "When questions about Platini's probity come up in Thursday's meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, it will be Hansen who is likely to be able to speak with some authority on the issue. That is because he is also a member of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, which was established in 2012. \n",
      "___ \n",
      "FUTURE OF BLATTER AND PLATINI \n",
      "The 90-day suspensions, which can be extended by 45 days, were imposed to remove Blatter and Platini from positions of power. The punitive sanctions, which could last years, would be implemented by FIFA's ethics committee following guilty verdicts - mostly likely before the Swiss criminal investigation reaches its conclusion. \n",
      "While the criminal case requires the attorney general to prove intent, the FIFA ethics code does not and the threshold for convictions within the sport is much lower. \n",
      "The code in place in 2011 says that sanctions can follow acts being \"committed deliberately or negligently.\" Blatter was ultimately responsible for FIFA when the payment was made and Platini was a fellow member of his ruling committee, whose other members did not know about the transaction. \n",
      "If FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert accepts there was a verbal agreement, Blatter and Platini could still be facing multi-year bans. If Eckert does not believe them, the payment could have been deemed corrupt and result in life bans. \n",
      "Blatter's career was coming to an end anyway but his disgrace will be complete if an absolute ban is the final chapter of a 40-year FIFA career. Blatter was planning to stand down in February after an emergency election prompted by his decision to stun soccer on June 2 with a resignation statement following the arrest of close associates. \n",
      "Platini, though, had his eyes on Blatter's FIFA seat. Now it seems highly unlikely Platini will ever lead world soccer, his reputation as a title-winning playmaker for France and Juventus threatening to be wrecked by the case. \n",

      "Article 7 Text: Walkthru: Bengals offense vs recent NFL history Paul Dehner Jr. , pdehnerjr@enquirer.com 10:17 a.m. EDT October 13, 2015 Taking a look at where the Bengals rank among recent runs of offensive consistency, plus, more on Vontaze Burfict, Adam Jones on BTS, Steelers survive, unleashing Tyrod, PFF review and Rick James. Fans cheer on Cincinnati Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert after he scored a touchdown against the Chargers. (Photo: The Enquirer/Sam Greene) \n",
      "For today's story in the paper which posted online last night I wrote about the versatility of the running game and snug fit Gio Bernard has been to the Andy Dalton arrival . The Bengals best weapons are having A.J. Green, Marvin Jones, Mo Sanu and Tyler Eifert all on the field at the same time. That sets up well for the quickness and receiving ability of Bernard. That's a large reason why he's been featured so much and enjoyed so much success. \n",
      "You can read about there here , including Hue Jackson still standing behind Jeremy Hill promising his time will come as different types of defenses confront the Bengals. \n",
      "As I researched the story, I searched this streak of five straight games with at least 389 yards gained by the Bengals against franchise history. I found this to be only the second time a Bengals offense achieved such a streak, the last coming 1986. \n",
      "Hey look -- nugget. \n",
      "Thought today's Walkthru would offer an opportunity to take the stat a step further. How does this stand up in all of the NFL over the last 10 years? The answer: Pretty well. \n",
      "Since the rule changes allowed offenses to blossom five years ago you can see the bump in teams running off streaks like this, but it's still not that long. \n",
      "Since 2005, here are the number of teams with a streak of at least five straight games in the same season gaining at least 389 yards as the Bengals have. Year: Team (Streak) -- Average per game 2015: Bengals (5 games) -- 421 2014: Broncos (6 games) -- 442 2014: Cowboys (5 games) -- 424 2014: Colts (7 games) -- 473 2014: Saints (7 games) -- 445 2013: Patriots (6 games) -- 471 2013: Eagles (6 games) -- 450 2013: Broncos (13 games) -- 466 2012: Saints (5 games) -- 460 2011: Saints (6 games) -- 518 2011: Saints (5 games) -- 482 2011: Packers (7 games) -- 423 2011: Patriots (5 games) -- 496 2010: Eagles (7 games) -- 435 2010: Chargers (5 games) -- 462 2009: Saints (5 games) -- 436 2009: Patriots (5 games) -- 470 2007: Jaguars (5 games) -- 422 2007: Patriots (8 games) -- 437 \n",
      "If the Bengals top 389 this week against Buffalo, eight teams fall off this list. That would only leave 10 others. Pretty elite company. \n",
      "Also, consider the number of teams to accomplish this task. You have the Saints on here five times with Drew Brees, Broncos on here twice with Peyton Manning, Patriots four times with Tom Brady, Eagles twice and then Packers, Chargers, Jaguars and Colts once. That's a total of eight franchises. \n",
      "Enjoy this while it lasts, folks. This ranks among the best offensive runs in the last 10 years. \n",

      "Thanks for the question, Josh. \n",
      "The first game Vontaze Burfict will be eligible to return is Nov. 1 against Pittsburgh. As for if that means he will return, nobody quite knows. The last we officially heard about Burfict was at cutdown day when Marvin Lewis made it sound like he expected him to return on that date near 100 percent. At this point, we can't be so sure. Until he's allowed to practice with the team his status will be a shrug. There's a difference between running through ropes on the side and taking on the Steelers at Heinz Field. Once he does return, there's no telling how the knee will respond or how he'll respond mentally. Ideally, the Bengals want him to be a difference-maker in December and January. That's probably where his impact lies, assuming he can get back by then. \n",
      "IN CASE YOU MISSED IT \n",
      "Lewis not interested in puffing smoke . Fairly expected, though, I couldn't help myself from just asking him why he can't just be excited about 5-0 including the win against Seattle. He's in head down, blinders on mode at this point. \n",

      "Starter Will Grier was suspended one year Monday for violating the NCAA's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Grier, who gained 20 pounds in his first 18 months on campus, failed a drug test in the last two weeks.\n",
      "Grier said he took an over-the-counter supplement, but did not specify which one. Grier delivered a heartfelt apology to teammates before doing the same publicly.\n",
      "\"I did not check with the medical staff before taking it,\" Grier said. \"I really hope that people can learn from this, learn from my mistake. I'm really, really sorry to everyone. Just really sorry.\"\n",
      "The school said it will appeal. The Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) are not facing a forfeiture of wins, and Grier won't lose any eligibility. He will return as a third-year sophomore next October.\n",
      "\"When you have an opportunity to sit down and visit with him and see the remorse and the sorrow, that's hard,\" McElwain said. \"That's really hard. As a coach, but more so as a human, to see someone go through that, it's not easy. But he knows we're here for him.\n",
      "\"It's a loss. But we also have other guys, and we've got to move forward. Hopefully guys will learn from this and see, as he said, it's an opportunity through his choices. Hopefully some guys will learn from it.\"\n",
      "Sophomore Treon Harris will start Saturday night at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0).\n",
      "It means the Tigers will face a backup quarterback for the fourth consecutive game.\n",
      "Perry Orth began the season as South Carolina's third-string QB, but got the start against LSU last week because of injuries to Connor Mitch and backup Lorenzo Nunez. The previous week, Eastern Michigan's Brogan Roback replaced injured starter Reginald Bell before facing the Tigers. And Syracuse started fourth-stringer Zack Mahoney against LSU late last month.\n",
      "Harris, meanwhile, played nine games as a freshman last season, completing 45 percent of his passes for 1,019 yards, with nine touchdowns and four interceptions.\n",
      "\"I got a pretty good idea we'll show up,\" McElwain said.\n",
      "According to NCAA rules, Grier will remain suspended during the appeals process. He can practice with the team while he's ineligible, but won't be allowed to travel.\n",
      "McElwain said Grier made an avoidable mistake.\n",
      "\"You and I can both go get it,\" McElwain said. \"Anyone in this room can. Anybody in this country can. The mistake is, and the lesson for whoever out there, make sure - just like we educate our guys now - you check with your medical staff before you put anything in your body.\"\n",
      "McElwain also did not identify what Grier took.\n",
      "\"Doesn't matter. Cough medicine,\" McElwain said. \"You have to know what you're putting in your body. Will admitted he didn't do it. I think that speaks for him. He's not putting it on anybody else. He's a stand-up guy. That's how he played the game and plays the game. He'll be back.\"\n",
      "The suspension provided Florida's surprising season with a startling twist.\n",
      "Grier and the Gators have been one of the most remarkable teams in the country in their first year under McElwain, the former Colorado State coach and Alabama assistant. The Gators already have matched last year's regular-season win total and have a commanding lead in the league's Eastern Division race.\n",
      "Harris will be tasked with helping them stay there.\n",
      "Harris started the opener and split snaps with Grier in the second week against East Carolina. He has not thrown a pass since. He did attempt a 2-point conversion against Mississippi and was in for two running plays at Missouri last week. He is 19-for-27 passing for 269 yards and two touchdowns.\n",
      "Former Vanderbilt receiver Josh Grady will serve as the backup against the Tigers.\n",
      "\"We have two really good quarterbacks and have a package for another one,\" McElwain said. \"This is not an excuse. It happened. Things happen in life, and if you want to use it as an excuse, so be it. But that's not what we're going to do.\n",
      "\"We're going to have a great week of practice, we're going to play our tails off against one of the best teams in the country on their turf.\"\n",

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) \n",
      "ROME (AP) — With some help from Italy, Croatia qualified for its fourth consecutive European Championship after a 1-0 win at Malta on Tuesday. \n",
      "Croatia claimed second place in Group H after Italy came from behind to beat Norway 2-1. \n",
      "Alessandro Florenzi scored one goal and set up another for Graziano Pelle as the Azzurri overturned a 1-0 halftime deficit in Rome. \n",
      "Ghana-born midfielder Alexander Teffey scored with Norway’s only shot of the first half. \n",
      "“We did what we had to do,” Italy coach Antonio Conte said. “We didn’t deserve to lose. I always want this intensity and this nastiness. We’re on the right road. It’s important to have this approach, whether you win or lose.” \n",
      "In Ta’Qali, Ivan Perisic scored midway through the first half for Croatia. \n",
      "Italy won the group with 24 points and Croatia —which had a point deducted for a swastika that was painted on the pitch before a match against Italy — finished second with 20. \n",
      "Norway took third place with 19 points, sending the Scandinavian squad to the playoffs. \n",
      "“They were much better than us in the 90 minutes and they of course deserved to win,” Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said. \n",
      "Croatia’s best performance at the Euros was reaching the quarterfinals in 1996 and 2008. Coach Ante Cacic, who was hired last month, has several strong forwards to choose from with Perisic, Mario Mandzukic — who is currently injured — and Nikola Kalinic, who recently scored a hat trick for Serie A leader Fiorentina against Inter Milan. \n",
      "Italy stretched its unbeaten streak in European Championship and World Cup qualifiers to 50 matches, extending back to a 3-1 loss to France in September, 2006. \n",
      "Conte was without several key midfielders, with Daniele De Rossi suspended and injuries to Andrea Pirlo and Marco Verratti. \n",
      "Still, the Azzurri were able to take control and create several chances before Teffey, who plays for Norwich City, gave Norway the lead. \n",
      "Teffey used one touch to drive a powerful effort from the edge of the area past outstretched goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. \n",
      "A header from Graziano Pelle just a few meters (yards) out went wide in the 35th for Italy’s best chance of the half. \n",
      "Roberto Soriano then had a long shot pushed wide by goalkeeper Orjan Nyland. \n",
      "A superb Nyland also negated efforts from Pelle and Florenzi late in the second half, before Florenzi’s equalizer arrived in the 73rd. \n",
      "Substitute Sebastian Giovinco crossed from the left and Haitam Aleesami attempted to stop the cross with his chest, leaving it for Florenzi to poke in. \n",
      "Less than 10 minutes later, Giovinco was again involved as Pelle finished off a counterattack following a cross from Florenzi. \n",
      "Norway ended with only one shot on target — Teffey’s goal. \n",

      "The 70-year-old coach informed players of his decision Monday night, said a person close to the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because South Carolina hasn't publicly announced Spurrier's decision. \n",
      "South Carolina hasn't named an interim coach, but likely would announce someone to finish out the season by Wednesday, the person said. \n",
      "The Gamecocks are 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier's 23 seasons coaching in the league at Florida and South Carolina. \n",
      "Spurrier, in the middle of his 11th season at South Carolina, did not return messages from the AP seeking comment. \n",
      "The coach's weekly press conference is still scheduled to be held at noon Tuesday. \n",
      "South Carolina freshman offensive lineman Christian Pellage said on Twitter, \"What a crazy day... I am blessed to say I was coached by a legend. Best of luck to you Coach Spurrier. Stay cocky!\" \n",
      "Spurrier considered leaving last December after the Gamecocks went 6-6 in the regular season. But the team beat Miami in the Independence Bowl, a victory that seemed to re-energize him. \n",
      "He said this summer he planned to coach two or three more years, then extended that to four or five years when several recruits who had committed to South Carolina backed away before signing day in February. \n",

      "Losses at Missouri and No. 6 LSU last week guaranteed Spurrier no better than a break-even season. Spurrier had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coaching in college at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) and South Carolina. \n",
      "South Carolina's inconsistency on offense this season has surely frustrated Spurrier, a Heisman Trophy winning quarterback at Florida who played for San Francisco and Tampa Bay in the NFL. After beginning his coaching career in the USFL, and leading Duke, he returned to the Swamp and took the Gators to a national championship with a high-flying, Fun-n-Gun attack. \n",
      "The Gamecocks are 11th in total offense in the SEC, averaging 341 yards a game. \n",
      "The high-water mark of Spurrier's 11 seasons at South Carolina was from 2011-13. The Gamecocks went 11-2 each season, led by quarterback Connor Shaw and top NFL draft picks like defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, receiver Alshon Jeffery and running back Marcus Lattimore. \n",
      "The Gamecocks have used three starting quarterbacks through the first half of this season, including former walk-on Perry Orth and true freshman in Lorenzo Nunez. \n",
      "South Carolina plays at home against Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2) on Saturday. \n",
      "Spurrier is the winningest coach ever at South Carolina and Florida. During his tenure at Florida he led the Gators to six SEC titles and a national championship before leaving his alma mater to see what he could do in the NFL. \n",
      "After two losing seasons with the Washington Redskins he returned to the SEC with South Carolina in 2005 and turned the perennially mediocre Gamecocks into championship contenders. \n",

It was at that moment that Dave and Kev’s Totally Irreverent Redneck Golf Classic (for charity) was born. A moment that will live in infamy. A beer fueled, infamous moment.\n",
      "Dave Wilcox and Kevin Crawford are two of the top Real Estate professionals in South Texas, and while they’re very good at selling real estate, they’re even better at having fun and raising money. What started as a crazy idea snowballed to a borderline out of control level in 2014, when they held their first event at The Quarry Golf Club. Relying on the loyalties of clients and friends that believed in them, they sold out their first tournament and raised over $47,000 for the BAMC Fisher House, with no experience. Kevin says “the most fun part of the whole thing last year was seeing some of San Antonio’s most successful professionals totally throw self respect out the window in order to act like a fool for a day.”\n",
      "Determined to make this tournament different and memorable, Dave and Kev created an environment that would undoubtedly irritate most serious golfers, but would surely be talked about for months to come. All teams were encouraged to dress in costume and would receive strokes off their score if they did. All sponsors were encouraged to have a party on their hole. Cheating, loud music and talking in backswings were also encouraged. Almost immediately the tournament caught the ears of Lone Star Beer of San Antonio, who agreed to become the title sponsor. Other sponsors such as Whataburger & Cavender’s Boot City quickly followed suit and asked to help sponsor.\n",
      "Upon opening registration for the second annual tournament, being held October 22, 2015, they almost immediately sold out their player packages. “Golf is dumb, and people are finally starting to realize that a tourney like ours is the only way to really have any fun,” Dave states. They’re currently looking for a few more hole sponsors and for one sponsor really willing to step up and support our troops and the BAMC Fisher House, for a $100,000 donation, Dave and Kev will get their logo tattooed on their rear ends. The goal is to grow this tournament into a nationally recognized event and offer all the support we can to our men and women who volunteer to serve and die for us every day.\n",

      "Associated Press HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) - A rippled white whopper weighing in at 1,969 pounds took the title Monday for plumpest pumpkin at an annual San Francisco Bay Area contest.\n",
      "Growers gathered with their gargantuan offerings to try to break the world record of 2,323 pounds, which was set by a Swiss grower during a competition in Germany last year.\n",
      "It didn't happen.\n",
      "But the winning entry at the Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-off in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco, was no small feat. Steve Daletas of Pleasant Hill, Oregon, won $12,000 for his lumpy, 1,969-pound pumpkin.\n",
      "\"It's been a good year,\" he said after the contest. \"I've never grown an official 1,900-pound pumpkin before.\"\n",
      "Forklifts and special harnesses carefully placed the massive pumpkins on an industrial-strength digital scale with a capacity of 5 tons as officials from the county agricultural commissioner's Office of Weights, Sealers, and Measures kept close watch.\n",
      "Second place went to Ron and Karen Root of Citrus Heights, California, for their 1,806-pound entry. A $500 prize also was awarded to the \"most beautiful\" pumpkin based on color, shape and size.\n",
      "With California in its fourth year of drought, some said the dry soil deflated their pumpkin-growing dreams.\n",
      "\"No doubt about it,\" Gary Miller of Napa, the 2013 winner, told Bay Area news station KNTV. He entered a 1,303-pound pumpkin.\n",

      "Article 34 Text: California to big-league ballplayers: Stop chewing tobacco Associated Press 7 hrs ago By JOHN ROGERS, Associated Press © AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2015, file photo, San Francisco Giants starting pitcher Jake Peavy works against a San Diego Padres batter during the first inning of a baseball game in San Diego. California lawmakers have taken the first step toward banning smokeless tobacco in state ballparks. LOS ANGELES — California lawmakers have taken the first step toward accomplishing something Major League Baseball could never do: Stop players from stuffing those big wads of chewing tobacco into their mouths during games.\n",
      "AdChoices With Gov. Jerry Brown signing a bill earlier this week banning the use of smokeless tobacco in all California ballparks, a practice dating to the days of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb now seems headed toward the sport's endangered species list.\n",
      "Although California is only one state, it is home to five of Major League Baseball's 30 teams, and team owners themselves have been pressing for a ban for years. Last May they got one in San Francisco, home of the reigning World Series champion Giants. In August they got another in Boston, site of fabled Fenway Park, and when Brown signed Assembly Bill 768 on Sunday one was already in the works for Los Angeles.\n",
      "\"Major League Baseball has long supported a ban of smokeless tobacco at the Major League level and the Los Angeles Dodgers fully support the Los Angeles City Tobacco ordinance and Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,\" the Dodgers said in a statement last month.\n",
      "Major League Baseball still needs buy-in from the players, however, because the statewide ban that takes effect before next season has no provision for enforcement.\n",
      "\"The question we've been asked is are we going to have police officers walking around checking lips, and no, that's not the case,\" said Opio Dupree, chief of staff to Assemblyman Tony Thurmond, D-Richmond, who introduced the bill. \"It's going to be left to the team and the league.\"\n",
      "Interviews with players in recent years indicate that many are ready to quit — if they could.\n",
      "\"I grew up with it,\" pitcher Jake Peavy told the Boston Globe last year when the newspaper polled 58 players the Boston Red Sox had invited to spring training and found 21 were users.\n",
      "\"It was big with my family,\" said Peavy who is now with the San Francisco Giants. \"Next thing you know, you're buying cans and you're addicted to nicotine.\"\n",
      "He added he would like to quit to set a better example for his sons.\n",
      "Last year's World Series MVP, San Francisco Giant's pitching ace Madison Bumgarner, also chews tobacco but told The Associated Press earlier this year he planned to quit after San Francisco became the first city in the nation to adopt a ban. That one, like the statewide provision, also takes effect next year.\n",
      "\"I'll be all right. I can quit,\" Bumgarner said in August. \"I quit every once in a while for a little while to make sure I can do it.\"\n",
      "All the players should, said Christian Zwicky, a former Southern California Babe Ruth League most valuable player who grew up watching the Los Angeles Dodgers play and says he never cared for seeing all that tobacco chewing and the spitting of tobacco juice that follows.\n",
      "It didn't influence him to take up the practice, the 22-year-old college student says, but he can see how it might have affected others.\n",
      "\"I understand the sentiment there,\" said Zwicky who adds he's not a big fan of government regulation but supports this law. \"You don't want these people that kids look up to using these products that could influence children in a negative way.\"\n",
      "Moves to adopt a comprehensive ban have been gaining support in recent years, fueled by such things as last year's death of popular Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres, who blamed his fatal mouth cancer on years of chewing tobacco. Former pitcher Curt Schilling, a cancer survivor, has also taken up the cause.\n",
      "Use of smokeless tobacco has been banned in the minor leagues for more than 20 years, but Major League Baseball and its players union haven't been able to reach agreement on a similar restriction. Players and coaches are prohibited from chewing tobacco during television interviews and can't been seen carrying tobacco products when fans are in the ballparks. But the chewing during the game continues.\n",
      "\"It's a tough deal for some of these players who have grown up playing with it and there are so many triggers in the game,\" San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy told the AP earlier this year.\n",
      "\"I certainly don't endorse it,\" said Bochy, an on-and-off-again user for decades. \"With my two sons, the one thing I asked them is don't ever start dipping.\"\n",

Area Democrats hope to continue the winning streak. , SUSAN WALSH, ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » DEMS DEBATE When: Coverage begins at 5:30 p.m.\n",
      "Where: Wynn resort, Las Vegas\n",
      "Candidates: Lincoln Chafee, Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley, Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb\n",
      "How to Watch/Listen: CNN/CNN.com. Westwood One News will broadcast the debate on its radio stations.\n",
      "Barack Obama not only gave America its first black president. He gave Inland Democrats momentum.\n",
      "In 2008, Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992 to win Riverside and San Bernardino counties. He repeated the feat in 2012, a year Democrats won several hotly contested races for Inland offices.\n",
      "As they gather to watch the first debate of Democratic White House hopefuls Tuesday, Oct. 13, local Democrats hope to keep the trend going for their party’s 2016 nominee.\n",
      "“We worked awfully hard for President Obama,” said Howard Katz, chairman of the Riverside County Democratic Central Committee. “That’s going to be repeated (in 2016).”\n",
      "Scott Mann, chairman of the Republican Party of Riverside County, said delivering the county for the GOP nominee is a top priority.\n",
      "“Frankly, neither (Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders) have the star power that President Obama had,” Mann said. “He was able to get out the vote unlike any other Democratic candidate in decades.”\n",
      "Traditionally, the Inland Empire has been a Republican bastion in a state that traditionally favors Democrats. Statewide, registered Democratic voters outnumbered registered Republicans 43 to 28 percent as of February.\n",
      "But in Riverside County, Republicans hold a 4 percentage point edge in voter registration. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 38 to 34 percent in San Bernardino County.\n",
      "Democrats are on a winning streak when it comes to competitive Inland elections. State Sen. Richard Roth, Assemblyman Jose Medina and Rep. Mark Takano, all Riverside Democrats, defeated well-funded Republicans in 2012, the same year Democrat Raul Ruiz staged a come-from-behind win against veteran GOP congresswoman Mary Bono.\n",
      "Last year, Democrat Pete Aguilar survived a competitive primary and a challenge from Republican Paul Chabot to win a San Bernardino County congressional seat vacated by a Republican. Also in 2014, Ruiz won re-election in a Riverside County district where the GOP has a slight voter-registration advantage.\n",
      "Obama won San Bernardino County with 52 percent of the vote in both his presidential elections. In Riverside County, he squeaked out a win over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and beat GOP nominee John McCain by roughly 2 percentage points in 2008.\n",
      "To end the Democrats’ winning streak with Obama, Mann said local Republicans are actively recruiting voters. An “aggressive” get-out-the-vote effort will launch “at the appropriate time,” he said.\n",
      "Katz said local Democrats will meet later this month to strategize for the 2016 election. He recalled what Inland Democrats did to help Obama, including knocking on doors, handing out literature and selling buttons and T-shirts.\n",
      "Which presidential candidate wins the Inland Empire might come down to how each party’s voters feel about their nominee. A nonpartisan Field Poll released last week showed support for Clinton among likely voters in California’s Democratic primary slipping, with support for Sanders growing from February to October of this year.\n",
      "Katz said he has noticed more enthusiasm from Sanders supporters compared to Clinton’s. “Bernie brings out that kind of emotionalism,” he said, adding that Sanders and Clinton are both well-qualified for the White House.\n",
      "One factor in Democrats’ favor is the growing ranks of Inland Latinos. As a group, Latinos tend to vote for Democrats.\n",
      "“Any credible Democrat has a good chance in the Inland Empire, provided that Hispanic Democratic turnout is strong,” said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College.\n",
      "However, if Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban American, wins the GOP nomination, “the advantage could shift to the Republicans,” Pitney said.\n",

      "Florida coach Jim McElwain has insisted for months that he has two quarterbacks capable of producing in the Southeastern Conference. \n",
      "The eighth-ranked Gators will find out soon if McElwain was being completely truthful. \n",
      "Starter Will Grier was suspended one year Monday for violating the NCAA's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Grier, who gained 20 pounds in his first 18 months on campus, failed a drug test in the last two weeks. \n",
      "Grier said he took an over-the-counter supplement, but did not specify which one. Grier delivered a heartfelt apology to teammates before doing the same publicly. \n",
      "\"I did not check with the medical staff before taking it,\" Grier said. \"I really hope that people can learn from this, learn from my mistake. I'm really, really sorry to everyone. Just really sorry.\" \n",
      "The school said it will appeal. The Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) are not facing a forfeiture of wins, and Grier won't lose any eligibility. He will return as a third-year sophomore next October. \n",
      "\"When you have an opportunity to sit down and visit with him and see the remorse and the sorrow, that's hard,\" McElwain said. \"That's really hard. As a coach, but more so as a human, to see someone go through that, it's not easy. But he knows we're here for him. \n",
      "\"It's a loss. But we also have other guys, and we've got to move forward. Hopefully guys will learn from this and see, as he said, it's an opportunity through his choices. Hopefully some guys will learn from it.\" \n",
      "Sophomore Treon Harris will start Saturday night at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0). \n",
      "It means the Tigers will face a backup quarterback for the fourth consecutive game. \n",
      "Perry Orth began the season as South Carolina's third-string QB, but got the start against LSU last week because of injuries to Connor Mitch and backup Lorenzo Nunez. The previous week, Eastern Michigan's Brogan Roback replaced injured starter Reginald Bell before facing the Tigers. And Syracuse started fourth-stringer Zack Mahoney against LSU late last month. \n",
      "Harris, meanwhile, played nine games as a freshman last season, completing 45 percent of his passes for 1,019 yards, with nine touchdowns and four interceptions. \n",
      "\"I got a pretty good idea we'll show up,\" McElwain said. \n",

      "Article 44 Text: Protesters with Padres y Jovenes Unidos rally outside a DPS school board meeting last month. Facebook Some Lincoln High School students are pushing back against a plan by Denver Public Schools to open a charter middle school on the LHS campus, located in southwest Denver. A protest organized by the community group Padres y Jovenes Unidos is scheduled for 5 p.m. tonight in advance of a 6 p.m. public comment session being held by the DPS school board.\n",
      "\"The school board, the community and the students agree there is a need for a high-quality middle school in the southwest,\" says Karissa Frolov, a youth organizer with the Denver-based group. \"But there are ways to go about it. You can't just put a middle school here and say, 'Let's see how it works.'\"\n",
      "The DPS plan calls for adding a branch of the high-performing DSST charter school network at Lincoln in the 2017-2018 school year. The school would actually open the year before but would be \"incubated\" at an existing DSST school for a year before moving to Lincoln. There are already six DSST middle schools and three DSST high schools in DPS. All nine are charter schools that focus on STEM education, which stands for science, technology, engineering and math.\n",
      "Middle schoolers in southwest Denver need better schools, DPS officials say: 47 percent of the area's sixth graders are enrolled in under-performing schools, according to a presentation by district staff to the school board last week. By comparison, the district's existing DSST schools perform very well — and officials hope that a new DSST middle school at Lincoln would do the same.\n",
      "Related Stories Obama touts his jobs plan at Lincoln High School in Denver (PHOTOS) Denver Public Schools But some community members are worried that adding a middle school at Lincoln will be detrimental to a high school they say is already overcrowded and lacking key resources. In a recent survey of more than 600 Lincoln students, 85 percent said they've been late to class because of overcrowding in the hallways and 92 percent said they've experienced long waits to get lunch. The survey was organized by students, some of whom spoke at a recent school board meeting in opposition to the plan.\n",
      "\"It just doesn’t make any sense to the students,\" Frolov says of the plan, which involves phasing in the middle school to add a total of 450 middle school students to the Lincoln campus by the 2018-2019 school year. \"Where are they going to put them?\"\n",
      "DPS officials say there's plenty of room. Lincoln has a capacity of 2,100 students but it hasn't been full for years — and the district predicts that the student population will shrink even more by 2018-2019. “As Lincoln becomes smaller, it creates the space for the additional students,\" Susana Cordova, DPS's chief of schools, said at a recent school board meeting . She denied that adding a middle school at Lincoln was the first step toward eventually closing the high school altogether.\n",
      "Denver Public Schools \"We are very committed to ensuring that Lincoln continues, that it has high-quality educational opportunities for students and that it needs to be fed by very strong middle schools across the board,\" she said. \"We have made the commitment that we will never turn students away from Lincoln.”\n",
      "But not everyone is convinced. The slogan of the campaign opposing DPS's plan? Fix Lincoln First.\n",
      "The school board is expected to vote on the plan on Thursday.\n",

      "Florida quarterback Will Grier has been suspended one year for violating the NCAA's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. The school announced the suspension at a news conference Monday and said it will appeal. The eighth-ranked Gators are not facing a forfeiture of any wins. But the suspension could cost Grier 25 percent of his college eligibility, making the redshirt freshman a junior when he returns next October. Grier, who gained 20 pounds in his first 18 months on campus, failed a drug test in the last two weeks. Grier said Monday he took an over-the-counter supplement, but did not specify which one. \"I did not check with the medical staff before taking it,\" Grier said during an emotional, minute-long apology. \"I really hope that people can learn from this, learn from my mistake. I'm really, really sorry to everyone. Just really sorry.\" According to NCAA rules, Grier will remain suspended during the appeals process. But he can practice with the team while he's ineligible. The Gators play at No. 6 LSU on Saturday night, and sophomore Treon Harris will make his first start since the season opener. Coach Jim McElwain said Grier made a mistake that could have been avoided by talking to the team's medical staff. \"You and I can both go get it,\" said McElwain, who said he learned of the suspension Sunday. \"Anyone in this room can. Anybody in this country can. The mistake is, and the lesson for whoever out there, make sure -- just like we educate our guys now -- you check with your medical staff before you put anything in your body.\" McElwain also did not identify what Grier took. \"Doesn't matter. Cough medicine. You have to know what you're putting in your body. Will admitted he didn't do it. I think that speaks for him. He's not putting it on anybody else. He's a stand-up guy. That's how he played the game and plays the game. He'll be back.\" Grier apologized to teammates before doing the same to Florida fans publicly. \"When you have an opportunity to sit down and visit with him and see the remorse and the sorrow, that's hard,\" McElwain said. \"That's really hard. As a coach, but more so as a human, to see someone go through that. It's not easy. But he knows we're here for him. \"It's a loss. But we also have other guys and we've got to move forward. Hopefully guys will learn from this and see, as he said, it's an opportunity through his choices. Hopefully some guys will learn from it.\" Grier and the Gators have been one of the most surprising teams in the country in their first year under McElwain, the former Colorado State coach and Alabama assistant. The Gators (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) already have matched last year's regular-season win total and have a commanding lead in the league's Eastern Division race. Harris will be tasked with helping them stay there. Harris started the opener and split snaps with Grier in the second week against East Carolina. He has not thrown a pass since. He is 19 for 27 for 269 yards and two touchdowns. He played nine games as a freshman last season, completing 45 percent of his passes for 1,019 yards, nine touchdowns and four interceptions. Former Vanderbilt receiver Josh Grady will serve as the backup against the Tigers (5-0, 3-0). \"We have two really good quarterbacks and have a package for another one,\" McElwain said. \"This is not an excuse. It happened. Things happen in life, and if you want to use it as an excuse, so be it. But that's not what we're going to do. We're going to have a great week of practice, we're going to play our tails off against one of the best teams in the country on their turf and this out to be a blast, man. \"This ought to be a celebration, this game, for what this is all about.

      "Article 51 Text: Madison County's David Metts growing into role as team's leader By Nicole Saavedra published Monday, October 12, 2015 close Prince Avenue Christian cruises past Athens Academy \n",
      "Madison County needed a spark to earn its first win of the season. \n",
      "On Friday, that came in the form of junior quarterback David Metts, who accounted for more than 400 yards of offense in the Red Raiders’ 59-29 win against host Chestatee. \n",
      "“He’s capable of doing a lot of things,” Madison County coach Chris Smith said. “He runs the ball really well; he throws really well. It wasn’t a surprise. I didn’t expect us to score 59 points going into that game, but offensively, our offensive line did a great job, our skill players stepped up and played very well. They flew around the whole night.” \n",
      "Metts ran 17 times for 174 yards and four touchdowns, including runs of 73, 13, 19 and 30 yards. He completed 14 of 25 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. In total, he tallied 411 yards of offense. Madison County finished with 505 yards of total offense. \n",
      "“It was a great feeling,” Metts said. “It was something we’d been wanting all season, honestly. We hadn’t felt it since the Oglethorpe game in our first scrimmage game and it was great to finally get a region game.” \n",
      "It was the first win for the Red Raiders since October 2014 and the first time they’d scored more than 50 points in a game since topping Northview 58-0 in 2002. And it was a big win for Metts, who took over the starting job for the final two games of last season after injuries piled up. \n",
      "“It was different last year because I felt like last year it was more just he’s hurt and I’m going to play until he’s back,” Metts said. “Last year, it was more I’m a guy. It was kind of scary, honestly. This year, it’s got my age friends playing with me and (I’m) more comfortable, I guess you could say.” \n",
      "Now, Smith has noticed that Metts is starting to grow into his role as the team’s leader. \n",
      "“(Before) he was more behind the scenes, wasn’t very vocal,” Smith said. “The leadership thing is something he had to work on, and as the year has gone along, as each year has progressed, he’s gotten better. This year, as the season’s progressed, he’s gotten a lot better taking a more vocal role with the offensive huddle and he’s had to play defense, too. It’s really pressed him to be more assertive, to take more ownership of it.” \n",
      "And Madison County hopes that translates to a few more wins before the season is over. They’ll host North Hall this Friday. \n",
      "“We can win a few more games this season before it’s over with,” Metts said. \n",

      "I was never a fan of Sarkisian’s rah-rah approach to coaching and it didn’t help when he issued an obscenity-laced speech at a team function last August in front of important, loyal and powerful USC boosters. Sarkisian later apologized, blaming the tirade on medications. But boosters don’t forget and, after USC’s home loss to Sarkisian’s former team, Washington, and Sarkisian not healthy enough to finish the Trojans’ Sunday practice, it was time for a change. \n",
      "Coaching major college football is now a high-pressure job. Sarkisian was 12-6 overall in his second year with the Trojans, who came off NCAA probation over the offseason when they earned the claim of 2015’s best recruiting class. The future may look bright, but right now the present is very cloudy. \n",

Though Utley’s slide appeared a tad late, I thought it was a legal play, and no intent to injure Tejada, who was spinning backward before the slide and in a prone position with his back to first base.

      "Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino remains defiant that his program will survive the allegations in a book by an escort claiming that former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. \n",
      "Pitino said Tuesday that the Cardinals \"will get through this the right way.\" \n",
      "The coach told a packed room at a tipoff luncheon that he understands the motivation behind Katina Powell's book \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" but questions the need for the alleged activities given the talent his program has produced. \n",
      "Pitino added, \"We will find out the truth, whatever it may be, and those responsible will pay the price.\" \n",
      "Pitino's comments twice drew applause from about 1,200 people who welcomed him with a standing ovation. \n",
      "It initially appeared the Hall of Fame coach would sidestep any comments about the firestorm that has developed over the past 11 days, joking that the NCAA told him not to \"say anything about anything.\" But unlike previous interviews in which Pitino said neither he nor assistants were aware of the alleged activities described in the book, he questioned the program's need for them in light of the development of recent stars, including Russ Smith and Gorgui Dieng. \n",
      "\"From our end of the thing, I don't get the 'why?' It doesn't make sense,\" said Pitino, reiterating his adherence to NCAA regulations. \n",
      "\"I know as far as I'm concerned, every coach has had rights and wrongs in their life. But every coach that has sat next to me ... knew what I was about as far as NCAA rules are concerned.\" \n",
      "Powell's book has sparked four separate investigations, including two in the past week. Last Tuesday, campus police chief Wayne Hall announced that his department is working with Louisville Metro Police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office to review the allegations for possible criminal charges. The University of Louisville Foundation announced two days later the hiring of a law firm to review the allegations. \n",
      "Separate investigations by Louisville's athletic department and the NCAA were launched immediately after the school was notified about the book's allegations in late August. No matter what it is discovered or how it ends, Pitino said the program will endure. \n",
      "\"We won't go by hearsay,\" Pitino said of the investigations. \"I know what this program is all about and feel very confident in what the players are all about. They will do right things on the basketball court and will represent you exactly the way you want as a Louisville basketball player.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WSOC-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up\n",

      "Article 61 Text: Tweet \n",
      "In the past, manager Tony Pulis has criticised the under-21s league for not being strong enough to push players into the first team, but the man nicknamed Big Dave by Albion fans believes rewarding the top two teams in that league with spots in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy is the answer. \n",
      "“I understand exactly what the gaffer means,” said the former centre-back. “Having a foot in the first-team camp and having a foot in the academy 21s camp, it’s hard, because how do you replicate 30 or 40,000 people on a Saturday? The grounds that we play at are smaller.” \n",
      "Matching up against the greater physicality of sides in League One and below could be the answer, and although the early rounds may not necessarily draw the crowds, there’s potential to play in front of some big numbers in the latter stages. What do you think? Log in and start commenting \n",
      "“To actually go and play physically against those teams, I think that would create a replica,” said Moore. “That way a lot of the under-21s league would probably keep more of their better players in to keep those top two spots. Going all the way to a Wembley final with the kids, what better way to replicate it? \n",
      "“The under-21s league will return back to what it used to be, which was really competitive football. I think we’ve lost a little bit of the edge by trying to replicate it, but we’re missing something in between. If rules are done like that, it would lift the clubs. \n",
      "“So I can understand the gaffer’s frustration and I can understand it having a foot in both camps because the Premier League is a ferocious beast at the moment and it gets bigger and bigger every year, the players get better and better every year. Tactically, there’s no room for error, and that’s why the young lads have to be at such a good standard.” \n",
      "Despite the manager’s misgivings over the under-21s league, Moore says Pulis is watching the youngsters with a close eye and, once a week, they get thrown under his gaze in a game against the first team. \n",
      "“The gaffer does like them in there,” said Moore. “He’s getting a good look at them. It comes towards the end of the week, and they get half an hour or an hour in front the of the gaffer.” \n",
      "And no wonder. James Shan’s team are currently on an unbeaten run of 11 games stretching back to last season. But there is still a huge gap to bridge. “There have been times this season that I’ve put the 21s against the first team and our lads are blowing because the first team are that good with the ball. \n",
      "“They’ve got their hands on their knees, bent over, having chased the ball for the last 40 minutes and I say ‘look at them now, they’re ready to go again, could you do that all week and then play against opposition on Saturday? Who are probably better? There’s your standard’. \n",
      "“And then it hits the message home where you’ve got to get to. Not to say that they cant get there.” \n",
      "More involved with the first team since Pulis took over, the 41-year-old played under the Welshman at Portsmouth in 2000. \n",
      "“I’ve just helped out as and when to be honest,” he said. “That’s why you’ve been seeing me in and around the first team as well which has been good.” \n",
      "But the crux of Moore’s job is getting the under-18s and the under-21s to make the jump into the first team. And it’s one he’s thoroughly enjoying. \n",
      "“That’s been the thing really, trying to educate the boys physically, mentally, and tactically with what’s needed when you get up into that first team,” he said. “As a player, I was once a scholar and a reserve team player so you kind of understand the mindset needed to get into it. Now I’m a coach, you can relay to the players on a day to day basis to bridge the gap to get into the first team, so it is a good position and I’m really enjoying the role.” Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \n",

      "Article 71 Text: Ravens must find some new strategies Mike Preston The Baltimore Sun (TNS) 12 hrs ago 0 \n",
      "It is panic time in Baltimore with the Ravens. \n",
      "After five games, the Ravens find themselves in the unusual position of last place in the AFC North, so that means it's firing time, according to some fans. In no specific order, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti needs to dismiss either general manager Ozzie Newsome, or coach John Harbaugh, or defensive coordinator Dean Pees. \n",
      "And once that is done, he needs to fire himself. \n",
      "Oh, yes, that will get it done. Six weeks into the 2015 season, the Ravens need to clean house in one of the NFL's top franchises during the past 20 years. \n",
      "It's time for a little perspective here. There isn't one person or area that has put the Ravens into their current position; it's a culmination of things over the years, some beyond their control. There is no need for a massive rebuilding job, not in the modern era of the NFL. \n",
      "If receivers Steve Smith Sr., tight end Crockett Gillmore and outside linebacker Terrell Suggs played Sunday, the Ravens would have beat the Cleveland Browns. And if the Ravens had one more impact player at receiver or in the secondary, they might have won a couple of more games this season. \n",
      "But the problem is that they have two impact players on the roster in quarterback Joe Flacco and Smith. Combined with the injuries, there is no margin for error and there have been plenty of mistakes. \n",
      "No head coach will use injuries as an excuse but they have played a part in the Ravens disappointing season. Suggs has been out since the first game, and Gillmore has missed the past two. Until Sunday, left tackle Eugene Monroe hadn't played since the first drive in Week 1, and Smith and fellow receiver Michael Campanaro weren't on the field against the Browns. \n",
      "Outside linebacker Elvis Dumervil and cornerback Lardarius Webb missed most of the second half against the Browns, so the Ravens were in a tough situation, even against Cleveland. \n",
      "Depth is a problem throughout the NFL, which is why there is so much parity and few quality teams. With so many new faces, the injuries affect the play-calling and determine how aggressive a team can be in certain situations. \n",
      "But the Ravens front office, particularly Newsome, deserves some blame for this 1-4 season. He gambled and re-signed aging players such as defensive tackle Chris Canty and Webb. Both have contributed little. \n",
      "Newsome signed free agents such as safety Kendrick Lewis and cornerback Kyle Arrington during the offseason, but the Ravens haven't gotten much out of those investments, either. They don't have a shutdown cornerback on the roster, but remember, Harbaugh and Pees had to sign off on Lewis and Arrington, as well. \n",
      "In the draft, the Ravens haven't selected a Pro Bowl offensive player since they took running back Ray Rice in the second round in 2008. The only defensive player drafted in that time to make a Pro Bowl was inside linebacker C.J. Mosley, a 2014 first-round pick. \n",
      "Those things keep adding up through the years. And the Ravens' failure to draft and develop quality receivers since the team moved here for the 1996 season have been well-documented. \n",
      "So on Sunday, that's why you had Kamar Aiken and Marlon Brown as starting receivers. In the rotation, the Ravens had Chris Givens and Jeremy Ross. \n",
      "Who? \n",
      "That's the point. Receiver Breshad Perriman, the team's top draft pick this year, can't get on the field because of a knee injury and tight end Maxx Williams, the team's second-round pick, has been outplayed by Nick Boyle, the fifth-round selection out of the University of Delaware. \n",
      "So, it appears this might be time for Newsome to huddle with his top assistants and scouts to develop some different strategies. This team is in need of more impact players and leaders. \n",
      "But you could see this coming. When a team signs a franchise quarterback, like the Ravens did when they re-signed Flacco in 2013, there is often a drop-off in overall talent, like there was in New Orleans with Drew Brees or in Pittsburgh with Ben Roethlisberger. Quarterbacks take up so much cap space, it creates weaknesses in other areas. \n",
      "The Ravens couldn't get in a bidding war to keep wide receiver Torrey Smith or outside linebacker Pernell McPhee this past offseason. Good players exit, and it takes time to develop or reload. \n",
      "Add to that the tough early schedule this year, which includes five of seven games on the road, four on the West Coast. \n",
      "It's just been a poor season. It happens. It is the opposite of 2012, when everything seemed to break right for the Ravens on the way to Super Bowl XLVII. This year, with the exception of Josh Scobee missing two field-goal attempts in Pittsburgh, everything seems to be going wrong, from the excessive amount of penalties and injuries to the lack of impact players. \n",
      "All you can do is work through it. There are no quick, easy answers. Tags\n",

      "Information: (209) 373-1500; stocktonheat.com; stocktonlive.com » Social News STOCKTON — Many things went well in the Stockton Heat’s season-opening blowout win. But the highlight may have been its stunningly effective power play. The Heat’s special teams produced three goals in the opener, and hopes to keep the success going as it plays host to the San Jose Barracuda at 7 p.m. Thursday at Stockton Arena. It wasn’t just that the power play went 3 for 6 in Stockton’s 7-0 win against the Rockford IceHogs. The Heat didn’t score on its first power play opportunity, but had several good chances and moved the puck well. There wasn’t a power play in which the Heat didn’t get at least one really good look at the net. “You want your PP to generate momentum for you, whether you score or not,” Heat coach Ryan Huska said. “I thought our players were sharp and prepared, and they were hungry.” Defenseman Jakub Nakladal played the point much of the time when Stockton had a man-advantage, and used his hard shot to produce two assists. Two of Kenny Agostino’s three assistant came on power plays. “(Nakladal) can hit it really well, we knew that about him,” Huska said. “ think he’s confident in fact that he has to use it for us have success.” “It was a great start, and it was important because you need to start the season well or you have problems,” said Nakladal, who played nine seasons in Europe before joining the Calgary Flames organization. “Now we can have more confidence. But still, it was one game, and we have a lot of work to do.” The schedule ahead After Thursday’s contest, the Heat leaves Stockton for road games at the Texas Stars (Oct. 21), San Antonio Rampage (Oct. 24) and San Diego Gulls (Oct. 30-31). It returns to Stockton Arena for Hot Pink 1, which is dedicated to breast cancer awareness, when it plays the Bakersfield Condors on Nov. 6 and Ontario Reign on Nov. 7. Constant back to Thunder Veteran defenseman Ryan Constant, who played six seasons with the Stockton Thunder of the ECHL, is back with his old club, now known as the Adirondack Thunder in the ECHL. Constant, 30, had a tryout with the Heat and was released by the AHL team on Oct. 3. He was signed to an ECHL contract by Adirondack last week. He played 304 games with the Stockton Thunder (2008-15). — Contact reporter Scott Linesburgh at (209) 546-8281 or slinesburgh@recordnet.com.

      "AP Baseball Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Chase Utley's appeal hearing on his two-game suspension has been scheduled for Monday, according to a person familiar with the process.\n",
      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday because no announcement was authorized.\n",
      "Utley was suspended two games by Major League Baseball Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre for his rough slide in Game 2 that broke the right leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. Utley was on the bench and didn't play in the Dodgers' 13-7 loss Monday night.\n",
      "Utley will be eligible to play for the rest of the best-of-five NL Division Series against the Mets, who led 2-1 going into Game 4 Tuesday night.\n",
      "\"The fact that they felt the play was unnecessary and they did what they did was enough,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Now we've moved past it, and you got to get ready to play.\"\n",
      "John McHale Jr., the baseball executive who will hear the appeal, informed MLB and the players' union of the timing of the hearing on Tuesday.\n",
      "If the Dodgers' postseason is over at the time of the decision, any suspension that is upheld would be served at the start of the 2016 regular season.\n",
      "Mets fans greeted Utley a former Philadelphia star, with loud booing and profane chants before and during Game 3.\n",
      "\"He played at Philly,\" Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. \"You play in Philly, I mean this is the same. Right? I think he was fine.\"\n",
      "Utley did not speak with reporters after Game 3.\n",
      "\"I know people are still probably up in arms about the whole thing, but I know Chase, he felt horrible about the kid getting hurt,\" Mattingly said. \"That's one of the things, I think guys that play the game hard, they feel like they play the game right. ... They want to play like that, but they're not looking to hurt anybody.\"\n",

      "Updated: Tue, Oct 13 2015, 03:26 PM \n",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills signed free-agent quarterback Josh Johnson on Tuesday in a move that raises questions regarding the status of banged-up starter Tyrod Taylor.Johnson was signed a day after coach Rex Ryan said Taylor was \"beat up\" and \"sore\" following a 14-13 win against Tennessee. Ryan then didn't go into specifics when asked whether Taylor might be too sore to play Sunday, when Buffalo (3-2) hosts Cincinnati (5-0).\"We all know he finished the game, but we'll see how he's doing,\" Ryan had said Monday. \"We'll be looking at him throughout the week. ... But he's sore now, I can tell you that much.\"Ryan is next scheduled to speak with reporters on Wednesday. Taylor was not spotted in the Bills locker room during a 45-minute period when players are available to reporters on Tuesday.Taylor was sacked four times and took several big open-field hits while nearly single-handedly rallying the Bills to score two touchdowns in the final 16 1/2 minutes. He finished with a team-best 76 yards rushing, including a 22-yard touchdown, and completed 10 of 17 attempts for 109 yards and a touchdown.Taylor finished the game despite leaving for one play in the fourth quarter after turning his left ankle while being tackled following a 24-yard run.Ryan also revealed Monday that Taylor has been bothered by a nagging ankle injury since training camp. Ryan didn't say when or which ankle Taylor hurt.Johnson adds experienced depth behind Taylor and backup EJ Manuel, the Bills former starter who lost his job a month into last season.In six NFL seasons, Johnson has 1,042 yards passing, five touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 29 games, including five starts. He was signed a day after being cut by Indianapolis, and has also played for Tampa Bay, Cleveland, Cincinnati and San Francisco.The Bills turned to Johnson after first expressing interest in signing Matt Simms off the Atlanta Falcons practice squad, two people familiar with the discussions told The Associated Press. Simms, however, elected to stay in Atlanta, the two people said speaking on the condition of anonymity because the Bills did not disclose that information.Simms is familiar with the Bills offense after spending the preseason in Buffalo before being cut on Sept. 4.To make room on their roster, the Bills cut kicker Billy Cundiff a week after signing him. Cundiff replaced Jordan Gay as the team's kickoff specialist, while veteran Dan Carpenter handled field-goal and extra-point duties. \n",

      "A quarterback other than Matthew Stafford threw a pass for the Detroit Lions on Sunday for the first time in 49 games. Head coach Jim Caldwell pulled him out of the game after his third interception, which led to the Cardinals gaining a 35-7 lead in the third quarter of a game the Lions lost, 42-17. NHL roundup: Lightning stop winless... \n",
      "\"It's like a pitcher not having a very good day,\" Caldwell said of the decision. \"If a pitcher comes out, obviously he's still the starter.\" \n",
      "Stafford threw three interceptions and finished the game 20 of 32 for 191 yards and one touchdown. He said Caldwell told him at halftime that he'd be pulled if he threw a third pick after throwing two in the first half, leading to his benching after the first second-half drive. \n",
      "\"We had nothing going at that time,\" Caldwell said of the decision. \"No spark, no explosiveness, no nothing.\" \n",
      "The Lions finished the game with six turnovers, including three in a second quarter the Cardinals won 28-0. They also had nine penalties for 85 yards, stopping progress on multiple promising drives and costing them lots of field position on special teams. \n",
      "But, after backup quarterback Dan Orlovsky entered to cheers in the third quarter, the quarterback decision remained the topic of discussion Monday, and Caldwell said Stafford isn't on a short leash. \n",
      "\"He's never been on a leash,\" Caldwell said. \"He's never been on any sort of a leash, and he won't be in the future.\" \n",
      "Plenty of Lions players accepted blame for the embarrassing loss and said they all need to play better to support their quarterback. The Lions are 0-5 for the first time since their 0-16 season in 2008. \n",
      "\"You can't play like that,\" safety James Ihedigbo said. \"Since I've been in the NFL, it's the worst football I've seen - let alone being part of it.\"\n",
