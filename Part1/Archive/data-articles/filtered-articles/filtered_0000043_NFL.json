Gino Gradkowski will be Stone's backup. \nQuinn said Monday he thinks wide receiver Julio Jones and linebacker Justin Durant will play against the Saints. Jones played through a hamstring injury in the 25-19 overtime win over the Redskins. Durant missed the game with an elbow injury. \nPerson, Durant and Jones did not participate in Monday's practice. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright \u00a92015  "
