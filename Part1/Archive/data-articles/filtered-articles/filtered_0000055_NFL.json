    "text": "A A \nFrom the drawers of the Top Secret Fyles: \nIf you are a fan of the Syracuse University football team, the program is literally and figuratively heading into the scariest past of the season slate. \nThe Orange, which has had its share of major injuries this season including to starting QB Terrel Hunt and, at one point, was playing with its fifth string signal-caller, has seen its 3-0 start turn into 3-2 overall. \nThe losses could mount in the coming weeks with the remaining opponents left on the schedule against quality Atlantic Coast Conference foes. \nAfter Syracuse\u2019s 45-24 loss at South Florida last Saturday, the Orange (3-2) is now looking down the barrel of Virginia (1-4), Pittsburgh (4-1), Florida State (5-0), Louisville (2-3), Clemson (5-0), North Carolina State (4-2), Boston College (3-3). \nSU will be fortunate to win two of its final seven games, and is probably looking at a 4-8 or 5-7 finish. \n\u25a0 The University of Southern California football team, whose head coach Steve Sarkisian was fired Monday after a one-day leave of absence on Sunday attributed to health concerns, limps into Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday to take on the Fighting Irish in one of college football\u2019s special rivalries. \nI was never a fan of Sarkisian\u2019s rah-rah approach to coaching and it didn\u2019t help when he issued an obscenity-laced speech at a team function last August in front of important, loyal and powerful USC boosters. Sarkisian later apologized, blaming the tirade on medications. But boosters don\u2019t forget and, after USC\u2019s home loss to Sarkisian\u2019s former team, Washington, and Sarkisian not healthy enough to finish the Trojans\u2019 Sunday practice, it was time for a change. \nCoaching major college football is now a high-pressure job. Sarkisian was 12-6 overall in his second year with the Trojans, who came off NCAA probation over the offseason when they earned the claim of 2015\u2019s best recruiting class. The future may look bright, but right now the present is very cloudy. \n\u25a0 Dodgers backup infielder Chase Utley has appealed his two-game suspension following a hard slide into second base that injured Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada in Saturday\u2019s Game 2 of their NLDS matchup. \nI thought it was a hard slide, a hard-nosed play by Utley, who was in the baseline. Though Utley\u2019s slide appeared a tad late, I thought it was a legal play, and no intent to injure Tejada, who was spinning backward before the slide and in a prone position with his back to first base. If the Mets are smart, they need to concentrate on winning Game 4 at Citi Field and not get sidetracked by emotions against the former Phillie. \n\u25a0 Richie Rich\u2019s Top 10 rankings in College Football: 1.
