It doesn't make sense,\" said Pitino, reiterating his adherence to NCAA regulations. \n\"I know as far as I'm concerned, every coach has had rights and wrongs in their life. But every coach that has sat next to me ... knew what I was about as far as NCAA rules are concerned.\" \nPowell's book has sparked four separate investigations, including two in the past week. Last Tuesday, campus police chief Wayne Hall announced that his department is working with Louisville Metro Police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office to review the allegations for possible criminal charges. The University of Louisville Foundation announced two days later the hiring of a law firm to review the allegations. \nSeparate investigations by Louisville's athletic department and the NCAA were launched immediately after the school was notified about the book's allegations in late August. No matter what it is discovered or how it ends, Pitino said the program will endure. \n\"We won't go by hearsay,\" Pitino said of the investigations. \"I know what this program is all about and feel very confident in what the players are all about. They will do right things on the basketball court and will represent you exactly the way you want as a Louisville basketball player.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WSOC-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up"
