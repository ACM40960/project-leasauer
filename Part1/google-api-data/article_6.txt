The 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships were held in Antwerp, Belgium at the Sportpaleis, from 30 September to 8 October 2023.[1] Antwerp hosted the event for the third time; previously the city hosted the first ever World Championships in 1903 and again in 2013.[2][3]

The championships was a qualification event for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. The top nine teams in both the men's and women's team qualifications (not including teams that qualified at the previous year's World Championships) obtained five quota places for Paris as a team.  Additionally, numerous individuals qualified with a nominative berth for the Olympic Games.[4]

The first qualification event for the 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships was the 2022 edition of the event in Liverpool, United Kingdom where the top 8 teams advanced on both the men's and women's side. The remaining 32 (16 per gender) team spots were determined at various Continental championships in 2023. 20 spots were conferred at the 2023 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships; 4 at the 2023 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the 2023 Pan American Artistic Gymnastics Championships, and 2 at the 2023 Oceania Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the 2023 African Artistic Gymnastics Championships. As such, both the men's and women's competition will feature 24 teams.

Individual all-around spots were awarded to the highest ranked gymnasts from nations who hadn't advanced a full team to the Championships. These spots were determined through the Continental championships process, with 40 male and 49 female spots being allocated. As hosts Belgium qualified a full team in both events, their allotted host spots were redistributed through the European Championships rankings, being awarded to Iceland's Valgard Reinhardsson and Luxembourg's Celeste Mordenti. 

Individual gymnasts also had an opportunity to advance to the Championships as event specialists through the 2023 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series. There were 8 spots available on each event for individuals also not from nations who had qualified a team.[5] In total, there were 48 spots available for men across six apparatus and 32 for women across four apparatus. Through all possible qualification routes, 208 men and 201 women are slated to participate in the competition.
